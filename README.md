# draft

Draft is a C++ serialization library, heavily inspired by [Boost.Serialization](http://www.boost.org/libs/serialization) and [cereal](https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/). By and large, draft is a learning project and should probably not be used in production -- instead, check out the previously linked alternatives.
